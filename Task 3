  PIPELINE PROCESSOR DESIGN 

4-Stage Pipelined Processor Design

1.Introduction
A pipelined processor improves performance by dividing 
instruction execution into multiple stages and allowing 
several instructions to be processed simultaneously. Each 
stage completes a part of an instruction in one clock cycle. 
This design focuses on a 4-stage pipeline supporting basic 
instructions such as ADD, SUB, and LOAD.

2.Pipeline Stages

Stage 1: Instruction Fetch (IF)
•	The instruction is fetched from Instruction Memory using the Program Counter (PC).
•	PC is incremented to point to the next instruction.
•	Output is stored in the IF/ID pipeline register.
Operations:
•	IR ← InstructionMemory[PC]
•	PC ← PC + 1

Stage 2: Instruction Decode / Register Fetch (ID)
•	The fetched instruction is decoded.
•	Source registers are read from the Register File.
•	Control signals are generated.
Operations:
•	Decode opcode (ADD, SUB, LOAD)
•	Read registers Rs and Rt
•	Immediate value extraction (if needed)

Stage 3: Execute / Address Calculation (EX)
•	Arithmetic or logical operation is performed using the ALU.
•	For LOAD instruction, memory address is calculated.
Operations:
•	ADD → ALU = Rs + Rt
•	SUB → ALU = Rs − Rt
•	LOAD → ALU = Base + Offset

Stage 4: Memory Access / Write Back (MEM/WB)
•	LOAD instruction accesses Data Memory.
•	Results are written back to the Register File.
Operations:
•	LOAD → Rd ← DataMemory[ALU]
•	ADD/SUB → Rd ← ALU Result

3.Supported Instruction Format

ADD
ADD Rd, Rs, Rt
Rd ← Rs + Rt

SUB
SUB Rd, Rs, Rt
Rd ← Rs − Rt

LOAD
LOAD Rd, Offset(Rs)
Rd ← Memory[Rs + Offset]

4.Pipeline Register Structure

Pipeline Register -	Stored Information
IF/ID 	-  Instruction, PC+1
ID/EX	  -  Operand values, control signals
EX/WB	  -  ALU result or memory data

5.Pipeline Execution Example

Instruction Sequence:

I1: LOAD R1, 0(R2)
I2: ADD  R3, R1, R4
I3: SUB  R5, R3, R6


Pipeline Timing Table:

Cycle 	IF	 ID 	EX	 WB
1     	I1	  –	   –	  –
2	      I2	  I1	 –	  –
3     	I3	  I2	 I1	  –
4     	–	    I3	 I2	  I1
5	      –	    –  	 I3	  I2
6	      –	    –	   –	  I3

6.Advantages of Pipelining

•	Increased instruction throughput
•	Better CPU utilization
•	Faster program execution

7.Limitations

•	Data hazards (e.g., LOAD followed by ADD)
•	Requires hazard detection or forwarding
•	Slightly complex control logic

8.Conclusion
A 4-stage pipelined processor efficiently executes 
basic arithmetic and memory instructions by overlapping 
instruction execution. This design demonstrates the core
principles of pipelining and is suitable for academic projects 
and simulations.
