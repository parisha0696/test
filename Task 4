        TASK - 4
   DIGITAL FILTER DESIGN 

1.Introduction

Digital signal processing (DSP) plays a vital role in 
modern communication, audio, image processing,biomedical
systems, and control applications. A digital filter is a 
fundamental DSP component used to modify or enhance of an
discrete-time signals by selectively passing or attenuating 
certain frequency components.

Among digital filters, Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters 
are widely used due to their inherent stability, linear phase 
characteristics, and ease of implementation in both software 
and hardware.

2.Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

1.To design a digital FIR filter based on given frequency specifications
2.To generate filter coefficients using MATLAB
3.To implement the FIR filter using Verilog HDL
4.To simulate and verify the filter performance
5.To analyze frequency and time-domain responses

3.Types of Digital Filters

Digital filters are broadly classified into:

1.	Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filters
2.	Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Filters

5.FIR Filter Design Methods

Common FIR design techniques include:

Window Method
Frequency Sampling Method
Optimal (Parks–McClellan) Method
Window Method (Used in This Design)
The ideal impulse response is multiplied by a window
function to reduce Gibbs phenomenon.

Common windows:

Rectangular
Hamming
Hanning
Blackman
