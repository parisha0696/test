        TASK- 1
  ARITHMETIC LOGIC UNIT (ALU)

1. Introduction

An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a fundamental component of a digital computer 
system. It is responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations required by 
the Central Processing Unit (CPU). The ALU takes binary inputs and performs operations 
such as addition, subtraction, and logical functions like AND, OR, and NOT. This document explains the complete design, Verilog implementation, testbench,
and simulation of a basic ALU.

2. Supported Operations

The designed ALU supports the following operations:

1. Addition – Adds two binary numbers
2. Subtraction – Subtracts one binary number from another
3. Logical AND – Performs bitwise AND operation
4. Logical OR – Performs bitwise OR operation
5. Logical NOT – Performs bitwise complement operation
Each operation is selected using a control signal called an opcode.

3. ALU Architecture

The ALU architecture consists of:
Arithmetic circuits (Adder and Subtractor)
Logic gates (AND, OR, NOT)
Control unit (Opcode selector)
Multiplexer (to select the final output)
The opcode determines which operation is executed.
Based on the opcode, the corresponding arithmetic or 
logical result is produced at the output.

4. Verilog Implementation of ALU

module ALU (
    input [3:0] A, B,
    input [2:0] opcode,
    output reg [3:0] result
);
always @(*) begin
    case(opcode)
        3'b000: result = A + B;      // Addition
        3'b001: result = A - B;      // Subtraction
        3'b010: result = A & B;      // AND
        3'b011: result = A | B;      // OR
        3'b100: result = ~A;         // NOT
        default: result = 4'b0000;
    endcase
end
endmodule

5. Testbench for ALU

module ALU_tb;
reg [3:0] A, B;
reg [2:0] opcode;
wire [3:0] result;

ALU uut (
    .A(A),
    .B(B),
    .opcode(opcode),
    .result(result)
);
initial begin
    A = 4'b0101;
    B = 4'b0011;

    opcode = 3'b000; #10; // Addition
    opcode = 3'b001; #10; // Subtraction
    opcode = 3'b010; #10; // AND
    opcode = 3'b011; #10; // OR
    opcode = 3'b100; #10; // NOT

    $stop;
end
endmodule


6. Simulation Report

The ALU design was simulated using HDL simulation 
tools such as ModelSim or Vivado. Different input 
combinations and opcodes were applied through the 
testbench. The waveform results confirmed that the 
ALU performs all arithmetic and logical operations
correctly. Each opcode produced the expected output, 
verifying the correctness of the design.
