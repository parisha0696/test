        TASK-2
      RAM DESIGN

1. Aim
To design and implement a simple synchronous RAM 
module with read and write operations using Verilog
HDL and to verify its functionality through simulation.

2. Introduction
Random Access Memory (RAM) is a volatile memory
used to temporarily store data in digital systems. 
In synchronous RAM, all memory operations (read and write)
are controlled by a clock signal, ensuring predictable and 
stable operation. Synchronous RAM is widely used in processors,
controllers, and FPGA-based systems.

3. Types of RAM
•	Asynchronous RAM – Operations depend directly on control signals.
•	Synchronous RAM – Operations occur only on clock edges.
This design focuses on Synchronous RAM.

4. Block Diagram Description

A synchronous RAM consists of:
•	Memory array
•	Address lines
•	Data input
•	Data output
•	Write enable signal
•	Clock signal

5. Signal Description

Signal-Description
clk-Clock signal
we-Write enable (1 = write, 0 = read)
addr-Address input
din-Data input
dout-Data output

6. Working Principle
•	When write enable (we) = 1, data present at din is written to the memory 
location specified by addr on the rising edge of the clock.
•	When write enable (we) = 0, data stored at the given address is read and
appears at dout on the rising edge of the clock.
•	All operations are synchronized with the clock signal.

7. Verilog Code – Synchronous RAM
module sync_ram (
    input clk,
    input we,
    input [3:0] addr,
    input [7:0] din,
    output reg [7:0] dout
);
    reg [7:0] mem [0:15];
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (we)
            mem[addr] <= din;   // Write operation
        else
            dout <= mem[addr];  // Read operation
    end
endmodule

8. Testbench Code
module sync_ram_tb;
    reg clk;
    reg we;
    reg [3:0] addr;
    reg [7:0] din;
    wire [7:0] dout;

    sync_ram uut (
        .clk(clk),
        .we(we),
        .addr(addr),
        .din(din),
        .dout(dout)
    );
    initial begin
        clk = 0;
        forever #5 clk = ~clk;
    end
    initial begin
        we = 1;
        addr = 4'd1; din = 8'hAA; #10;
        addr = 4'd2; din = 8'h55; #10;

        we = 0;
        addr = 4'd1; #10;
        addr = 4'd2; #10;
        #20 $finish;
    end
endmodule

9.Simulation Demonstrating RAM Functionality

Simulation is used to verify the correct operation of the
synchronous RAM design before hardware implementation. The
simulation confirms that data is properly written into memory 
locations and accurately read from them in synchronization with
the clock signal.

10.Simulation Procedure
1.	Initialize all input signals (clk, we, addr, din).
2.	Apply a periodic clock signal.
3.	Enable the write operation by setting we = 1.
4.	Provide address and data inputs to store data in memory locations on the rising edge of the clock.
5.	Disable the write operation by setting we = 0.
6.	Apply read addresses and observe the output data (dout) on the rising edge of the clock.
7.	Compare the read data with the written data to verify correctness.

11.Conclusion
The simulation successfully demonstrates the functionality of
the synchronous RAM. The RAM correctly performs write and read
operations in response to the clock and control signals, confirming 
that the design meets the required specifications.
